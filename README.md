# Adaptive Cruise Control - Automotive Systems

This repository contains the implementation of an **Adaptive Cruise Control (ACC)** system using **MATLAB**. The project focuses on simulating the behavior of an ACC system in an automotive environment, where the system automatically adjusts the vehicle's speed to maintain a safe distance from the vehicle ahead.

## Features
- Simulation of ACC system dynamics in MATLAB.
- Real-time control of vehicle speed based on distance and speed of the vehicle ahead.
- Implementation of basic sensors to detect the lead vehicle.
- Adjustable parameters for tuning the ACC system, including time headway and reaction time.

## Requirements
- MATLAB (preferably the latest version).
- Simulink (optional for advanced simulation).

## How to Use
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Kamyarzand/Adaptive-Cruise-Control---Automotive-Systems.git
